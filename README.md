# Low-bias exciton quenching
This repository contains code for simulating photoluminescence quenching in organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) operated at low biases. If you find this code useful, please cite our publication:

# Running this code
Most of the python code for the quenching simulations uses standard scientific python packages (numpy, matplotlib, scipy)--any python 3.5+ version of these packages should work. For an exact copy of the environment used in this publication, see the `oled.yml` environment file in https://github.com/jsbangsund/conda-envs. 

To edit the optical simulations of the optical generation profile and outcoupling efficiency, you will need `oledpy` (https://github.com/jsbangsund/oledpy) or your own preferred optical simulation package. Otherwise, the simulated optical profiles used in our publication are saved in the `Reference Data` folder.
